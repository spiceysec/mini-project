================================================ Project Background ================================================

 This project is for a cafe ordering system in which an employee could log an order, and track the order so they can
 meet their demands at the cafe. 

 =============================================== Client Requirements ===============================================

 The client requested the soft ware must hold a collection of products, orders and couriers in which they can edit,
 update or remove easily. They will also need to update only specific aspects of the orders eg. customer number,
 status etc. The client wanted it to perssist on exit so they don't lose their data and then load that data when 
 the software is started back up. The client was a robust, reliable solution and to recieve future updates regarding
 this software.

 ============================================== Meeting Requirements ===============================================

 The software designed has been carefully designed so each functionallity is exactly what the client requested. For
 each request of the client, a systematic function was implamented to serve each requirement whilst the functionality
 of the software has stayed the same easing for a user firendly experience for the users, using thi software.

 ===================================================== Testing =====================================================

 The software has been tested by mocking the sql connection.

 ============================================== Future Implementation ==============================================

 In future updates, a new, upgraded layout/design will be implamenteded making the software more like eye-candy and
 more friendly. Taking use of the TKinter libery would enhance the look and bring it further into the future and
 further improoving user experience. Adding further input obvuscation so invalid user inputs cannot break certain
 aspects of the programme.

 ======================================== What I enjoyed About This Project ========================================

 I enjoyed creating/designing the SQL databse the most as I find it enjoyable, along with previosuly doing SQL
 injection attacks with SQLMap, burpsuit etc. I also enjoyed learning more about python and developing my knowlegde
 with python.
